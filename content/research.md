###  _Are incentive effects from fiscal equalization underestimated?  Evidence from a Swiss reform_ 

[UNIL Econ working paper 21.13](https://www.unil.ch/de/en/home/menuinst/publications/working-papers.html) - [current manuscript](/./images/draft_2021_22_11.pdf) (11/2021)

**Status:** Submitted.


This paper investigates the incentive and redistribution effects of fiscal equalization on local tax rates. Using quasi-experimental evidence from a reform in a municipal equalization scheme, I propose three refinements to current empirical estimations of incentive effects of fiscal equalization. My results show that past literature using marginal equalization rates may have underestimated incentive effects from fiscal equalization.

## Work in Progress

### _The impact of fiscal decentralization on commuting decisions_  

with Jeremy Zuchuat

**Status:** Ongoing.

What happens when cities expand and become less administratively fragmented? This research aims at exploring and analyzing how fiscal decentralization coupled with progressive taxation impacts individual commuting decisions. Based on a monocentric model with decentralized progressive taxation and commuting disutility, we show that fiscal federalism makes rich individuals less sensitive to commuting. Thanks to random utility theory and our theoretical framework, we then estimate a location choice model for the 4 largest agglomerations in Switzerland. Our results show that well-off households are more sensitive to taxes, and less sensitive to both housing prices and commuting distance/time. Based on our estimates, we perform various counterfactual exercises to show that shutting down fiscal federalism would "gentrify" urban city-centers.
