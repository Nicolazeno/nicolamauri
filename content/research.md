###  _Fiscal Equalization Pushes Up Local Tax Rates: Evidence from Switzerland_ 

[current manuscript](/./images/equalization_2023_02.pdf) (02/2023)

**Status:** Submitted.


This paper investigates incentive effects of fiscal equalization on local tax rates. I propose two refinements to current empirical estimations of these incentive effects. I show that local policy makers may conceive of changes in equalization transfers as stemming from discrete rather than marginal changes in the tax base, thus considering “supramarginal” equalization rates. Second, I study “effective” equalization rates, conditioned on the current tax rate. To identify
the incentives created by equalization grants I investigate the reform of an inter-municipal equalization scheme in Switzerland. My baseline estimate from supramarginal equalization rates is 2-3 times larger than that found in previous comparable studies. I however do not find any effect for effective equalization rates.

### _Commuting and Income Sorting in Fiscally Decentralized Cities_

**Status:** Submitted.

Decentralized taxation affects numerous dimensions of economic activity, but how it shapes individual commuting decisions and spatial income sorting is still not well understood. We develop a structural model of individual location choices in a fiscally decentralized monocentric city with explicit commuting costs. Income sorting arises from non-homothetic housing preferences combined with decentralized progressive income taxes, which affect the willingness to commute of high-income individuals more than that of low incomes. This induces high incomes to be more willing to commute to low-tax jurisdictions. We estimate this model using micro-level data on moving decisions in Switzerland. Based on a random utility framework, we find that lower local taxes directly increase individuals’ willingness to commute and that high incomes are less sensitive to commuting. In a counterfactual exercise, we show that uniform taxation within urban areas would lead to more high-income individuals locating in central jurisdictions, hence enduring lower commutes.

###  _How Fiscally Autonomous Are Local Governments? An Empirical Test_

Available on request.

**Status:** Ongoing.

How freely can local jurisdictions change their taxes and spending? I propose an empirical test of the effective degree of municipal fiscal autonomy. Based on a tax competition model where jurisdictions are are partially expenditure constrained, I derive a testable prediction: tax cuts triggered by a small positive exogenous revenue shock will be stronger with higher perceived tax-base mobility the less fiscally constrained is the local decision maker. I apply this test using a revenue shock generated by a reform in an inter-municipal equalization scheme within a Swiss canton. Tax-base mobility is proxied by the availability of zoned land reserves. I find that higher residential land availability is associated with stronger tax rate responses, but I find no statistically significant results for industrial land reserves. In light of the theory, this suggests that the effective degree of fiscal autonomy of local jurisdictions is low. Usual indicators of fiscal decentralization based on public accounts might overestimate the actual autonomy of local governments.
