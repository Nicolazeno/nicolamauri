# Nicola Mauri

I am an economist currently working as a scientific collaborator at the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. I hold a PhD from the [Economics Department of HEC Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/de/en/home.html) and am affiliated to the [Public Finance Unit](https://www.unil.ch/idheap/en/home/menuinst/unitescompetences/finances-publiques.html) of the Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration. In may-june 2022 I was a visiting researcher at [VATT](https://vatt.fi/en/frontpage).

My research interests include public and regional economics, with a focus on fiscal federalism and tax-competition. I am fascinated by data analysis and visualization, econometric methods and policy-evaluation.
