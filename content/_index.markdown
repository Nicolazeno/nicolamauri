# Nicola Mauri

## _PhD in Economics, University of Lausanne_
I am an economist currently working as a scientific collaborator at the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. I am affiliated to the [Economics Department](https://www.unil.ch/de/en/home.html) and the [Public Finance Unit of IDHEAP](https://www.unil.ch/idheap/en/home/menuinst/unitescompetences/finances-publiques.html). 

I am interested in public and regional economics, in particular topics related to fiscal federalism and tax-competition. I am fascinated by data analysis and visualization, econometric methods and policy-evaluation.
